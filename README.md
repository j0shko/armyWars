# Army wars
Simple medieval battle simulator between two same-size armies.

ver 1.0
- generals
- 4 unit types (Archers, Cavalrymen, Swordsmen, Spearmen)
- terrain and terrain modificators
- unit type strengths and weaknesses
- two phases of battle (ranged fight and melee fight)

future versions thoughts
- day / night modificators
- more terrains
- better melee phase with unit count taken into account 
		(right now one Cavalryman(80) can kill 25 Cavalryman(79) if all modificators all 1)
- better class structure which supports mixed unit types (like mounted archer which has
		both bow and sword)
- more unit types
- tactics of attack (flanking, straight attack, reinforcements ...)
- random effects like sicknesses, zombies, mother of dragons comes and kills some units, treason
